<h2>Data & Question</h2>
<h4>Question:<br>"Does the performance tend to be low if the number of total treated patients is too big?" </h4>
<p>
    The data was downloaded from NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre. It recorded the waiting time for
    suspected and diagnosed cancer patients from 2009 to 2017. The data from April of 2016 to March of 2017 was
    extracted for this visualization. The original data set has 11 different attributes include "Period", "Year" and
    "Month" describing time; "Standard" describing standard waiting time; "Area Team" and "ORG. code" indicating the
    service team; "Care Setting" and "Cancer Type" describing the situation of cancer; "Total Treated" and "Within
    Standard" telling the number of patients should be treated and had been treated; and "Branches" indicating number of
    branches of organization. Additionally, two attributes were added: one is "Performance" which measures the
    percentage of patients being treated within standard waiting time, and the other is "Suspected" which indicating if
    the cancer if suspected or diagnosed.
</p>
<h2>Description of Visualization</h2>
<p>
    The visualization intended to illustrate if there is a difference of performance between any attributes to see what
    might influence the performance, thus, in addition to the main question, tasks such as "Does the performance tend to
    be low if the cancer was diagnosed but not suspected?" and "Is the performance influenced by the standard waiting
    time?". The main question to address is comparing numbers with numbers, therefore, associating bar chart and a line
    graph was considered. Moreover, to address other intended tasks at same time, the idea was grouping the labels of
    x-axis, that is, put the cancer type which has the same standard waiting time together along the x-axis.
</p>
<p>
    The total treated number of different cancer type was illustrated in bar chart and the performance was illustrated
    in scatter plot. The category of standard was labeled in the x-axis at the top. Furthermore, each color of bars
    indicates a type of cancer and of scatter points indicates a category of standard (including sub-category). It was
    found that all suspected cancer were under standard of two week waiting which made it easier to address both tasks.
    Therefore, they were put at the left of the chart and the others were put at the right so that it could be easier to
    find the difference of performance between suspected and diagnosed cancer by comparing the left and right side of
    the chart.
</p>
<p>
    To enable the reader to acquire the specific data of each node, a interactive mouse tooltip was developed. When the
    mouse moves in or over a bar or a scatter point, there will be a tooltip showing the detail data and moving with the
    mouse.
