<h2>Data & Question</h2>
<h4>Question:<br>"Does the performance tend to be low if the number of total treated patients is too big?" </h4>
<p>
    The data was downloaded from NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre. It recorded the waiting time for
    suspected and diagnosed cancer patients from 2009 to 2017. The data from April of 2016 to March of 2017 was
    extracted for this visualization. The original data set has 11 different attributes include "Period", "Year" and
    "Month" describing time; "Standard" describing standard waiting time; "Area Team" and "ORG. code" indicating the
    service team; "Care Setting" and "Cancer Type" describing the situation of cancer; "Total Treated" and "Within
    Standard" telling the number of patients should be treated and had been treated; and "Branches" indicating number of
    branches of organization. Additionally, two attributes were added: one is "Performance" which measures the
    percentage of patients being treated within standard waiting time, and the other is "Suspected" which indicating if
    the cancer if suspected or diagnosed.
</p>
<p>
    The key features used in visualization were "Cancer Type", "Standard", "Total Treated", "Suspected" and
    "Performance". "Total Treated" in the chart was the sum of total treated number of different cancer type;
    "Performance" for scatter plot was the average value of each cancer type. The data was processed by Tableau during
    sketching. Tableau can do computation like calculating sum or average of certain measurement according to the
    need of visualization and allow user to export the processed data into a table storing in a CSV file. For example,
    in this visualization, sum of number of total treated patient of different cancer type was needed to draw the bar
    chart, Tableau can compute that sum and generate the chart, then user can export the table of data of the chart.

<h2>Description and Implementation of Visualization</h2>
<p>
    The visualization intended to illustrate if there is a difference of performance between any attributes to see what
    might influence the performance, thus, in addition to the main question, tasks such as "Does the performance tend to
    be low if the cancer was diagnosed but not suspected?" and "Is the performance influenced by the standard waiting
    time?" was intended. The main question to address was comparing numbers with numbers, therefore, associating bar
    chart and a line graph was considered at first. Moreover, to address other intended tasks at same time, the idea was
    grouping the labels of x-axis, that is, put the cancer type which has the same standard waiting time together along
    the x-axis. However, in the final visualization, line graph was changed to scatter plot as the change of average
    performance of each cancer type illustrated by line graph could not convey a meaningful trend, each average
    performance was just a unique attribute of each type of cancer.
</p>
<p>
    The total treated number of different cancer type was illustrated in bar chart and the performance was illustrated
    in scatter plot. The category group of standards was labeled in the x-axis at the top. Furthermore, each color of
    bars indicates a type of cancer and of scatter points indicates a category of standard (including sub-category). It
    was found that all suspected cancer was under standard of two week waiting which made it easier to address both
    tasks (i.e. put all suspected cancer type to one side of the chart, put other two week waiting standard cancer next
    to them, and then put other types of cancer in the chart in group of standards). Therefore, all suspected cancer was
    put at the left of the chart and the others were put next to them so that it could be easier to find the difference
    of performance between suspected and diagnosed cancer by comparing the left and right side of the chart.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, to enable the reader to acquire the specific data of each node, an interactive mouse tooltip was
    developed. When the mouse moves in or over a bar or a scatter point, there will be a tooltip showing the detail data
    including the sub-category of standard and moving with the mouse. This tooltip was generated when the page is
    loaded, but its opacity was set to be 0 so that it cannot be seen. When the mouse enters a bar or a point, it will
    load data of corresponding cancer and its opacity will be set to 1.0 so that readers can see it. To make it move
    with the mouse, the position of it was set to change with the mouse position, and as its type of position was set to
    be "absolute", it will not be influenced by other elements of the page.
